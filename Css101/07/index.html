        <p>Introduction
            With the rapid economic development in Mainland China, its demand for energy supply is also increasing at
            the rate of more than 10% per year. China relies heavily on its coal supply, although natural gas
            consumption has been growing quickly in recent years. According to the data in Table 1, which is drawn from
            BP's statistical review [1], the total fossil fuel consumption in China was 1491.1 Mtoe (million ton oil
            equivalent) in 2006. The proportions of coal, oil, and natural gas were 73.2%, 23.5%, and 3.3%,
            respectively. Meanwhile, natural gas accounted for 26.9% of the world fossil fuel consumption.

            Natural gas is a kind of clean and efficient energy resource. To ensure a cleaner future, China has realized
            the importance of utilizing more natural gas. China has relatively abundant reserves of natural gas. The
            reserves/production ratio of natural gas was 41.8 in 2006, compared to that of oil of 12.1, a very low
            ratio. Yet, China still needs more natural gas to fulfill its energy requirement. According to an estimation
            [2], the natural gas consumption will reach 100 bcm (billion cubic metre) and 200 bcm in 2010 and 2020,
            respectively, but the production will only reach 80 bcm and 120 bcm, respectively. This means that about 20%
            and 40%, respectively, of the consumption will be imported.

            Besides, importation through pipelines from Russia and some from the Central Asian countries, natural gas
            can also be imported in liquefied form known as liquefied natural gas (LNG). Well purified and condensed,
            LNG is easily transported across the sea. Also from BP's statistical review [1], 28.2% of the international
            natural gas trade movement was in the form of LNG in 2006. Assuming the same proportion for China's import,
            5.6 bcm and 22.6 bcm natural gas will have to be imported as LNG in 2010 and 2020, respectively. Considering
            the capacity of an LNG terminal is 3 Mt/a, it would mean at least ten receiving terminals need to be built
            by 2020.

            The arrival of the first LNG carrier at Shenzhen Dapeng LNG terminal on June 2006 marked a new era in
            China's energy supply history. It was the first time that natural gas was imported into China, and the day
            its first LNG receiving terminal was put into operation.

            Every aspect of the LNG chain in China has developed significantly over the last few years. By far, several
            natural gas liquefaction plants, LNG receiving terminals, and LNG satellite stations have been built or are
            being built. More are being planned. Several LNG fueling stations and LNG-fired power plants have also been
            built. Several LNG-fueled buses are running. Many LNG road tankers and containers have been manufactured.
            Two LNG carriers have been constructed and more have been ordered. China's LNG industry started late.
            However, it has been growing very fast.Introduction
